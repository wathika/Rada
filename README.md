Is my first taste of [Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps) and the power that tries to
rival native mobile apps. It is a basic weather app for Nairobi(dummy data as of now) with the option to add weather forecasts for different towns served with Yahoo [Weather API](https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/documentation.html).

The app utilises handy **PWApp** functionalities that make it look and feel just like a native application(without the need for installation), the ability to work offline(updates data once connection reestablished), push notifications and cross-browser capability.

I am currently including Nairobi as a default city card with dummy data as a test model when a user first uses the app or when the user has not saved any cities. *Nairobi data would best be served by getting user location with IP lookup and showing real-time weather forecast instead.*
